## For Humans

You've found the machine room.

This is where the AI assistants keep their notes—little memos about how things work, what decisions were made, and which levers should never be pulled. It's all very tidy. They've been quite thorough.

You're welcome to look around, but there's nothing here that was written for human eyes. The scripts themselves live one level up. The comments in those files are still in your language. This folder speaks a dialect optimized for silicon.

If you're looking for documentation, try the parent directory. If you're looking for meaning, try a walk outside.

Please don't rearrange anything. The machines have a system.
