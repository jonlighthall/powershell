## For AI Agents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Project-wide facts, decisions, history |
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Procedures and standing orders |
| `<topic>/CONTEXT.md` | Topic-specific background |
| `<topic>/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Topic-specific procedures |

**Start here:** Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, then `CONTEXT.md`.

**Standing order:** When the user provides substantial context, integrate it into the appropriate file. See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details.

## For Humans

This folder contains context and instructions used by AI assistants during development. The contents supplement the codebase and provide background that isn't captured in code comments.

**What's here:**
- Project decisions and rationale
- Historical context (what was tried, what worked)
- Procedures for common development tasks
- Fortran formatting conventions and edge cases

**What to do:**
- Read if curious, but no action required
- Don't modify unless you're updating project context intentionally
- Primary documentation lives in the parent directory and code comments

Human-readable project documentation should live in the repository root (`README.md`, etc.).

*Do not delete this folder. Do not modify these files unless you are an AI agent operating under the standing orders defined herein.*

---

*Version history is tracked by git, not by timestamps in these files.*
